2/5/15

I suppose
this is a poem

But it is
still 100% true

Two
twenty-two twenty-two

Last night I
woke up at 2:22 AM

Then I looked
at the seconds place

Glowing green

Ascending
faster than normal seconds

I think,
because I was half asleep 

And I decided
to watch the clock get to 

2:22:22

With out
deciding to do so

My thoughts
were saying 

"Prepare"
over and over 

On the way to
- 2:22:22

Prepare
Prepare Prepare

I wanted to
ask myself

"Prepare for
what?"

But there
wasn't time to ask

Then at 2:22:21

I heard the answer

Prepare
Prepare Prepare ...

ACTION!

Only time was
tricky 

And I was
late 

When my mind
said action 

It was 

2:22:23

All of that
preparation 

And I blew it.
I was late.

I feel the
need to remind you, that this is true. It happened to me last night

Although I
felt a moment of real failure

I was very tired
and fell fast asleep

Then -- I was
amazed to see

I awoke again
at 3:33

This is true

I decided to
try again 

This time to
see

3:33:33

And as the
seconds propagated

I didn't have
time to ask how

I could hear
the word 

Prepare 

With each
silent tick of the clock 

Prepare
Prepare Prepare

"Prepare for
What?"

Then at
3:33:31

The voice
said 

Action!

At precisely
3:33:33

This was all
so miraculous 

A marvel of
my subconscious mind

I wanted to
stay awake 

And
contemplate 

But I was
pleased my victory 

At 3:33:33

Doing it
right was a drug

I felt waves
of relation and pleasure

Confidence
and self-assurance

I think I was
instantly sleeping again

No time to
ask myself 

What is this
all about?
